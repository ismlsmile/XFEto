#Xamarin.Forms.Shim
###Use Xamarin.Forms on unsupported platforms.
This package contains all the classes necessary to implement the platform components of Xamarin.Forms without
access to any internal members.
You'll still need to actually implement renderers to your target toolkit to use Forms to create applications.
